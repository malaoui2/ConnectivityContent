# API Reference

Hotwire QuickConnect is a set of APIs that allow a client system to interact with the information
available in the [Hotwire Hotel Extranet](https://extranet.hotwire.com). In turn, that information is used
by Hotwire.com and its affiliates to display and sell hotel rooms to travelers.
Currently the Hotwire QuickConnect API can be used to create and update a hotelâ€™s availability, rates,
and inventory (ARI), and retrieve recently confirmed and/or cancelled bookings. The ARI functionality
includes the ability to set the number of available rooms, per-day rate amounts and extra person
charges, and several restrictions. Retrieved bookings contain guest and Hotwire single use credit card
information.
